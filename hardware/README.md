Here you can find the resources to build the wind tunnel and light tunnel prototypes described in the original [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00964-x).

**Note**: We are still working on documenting the blueprints, electronics diagrams and component lists. Please check again soon or shoot us an [email](mailto:juan@causalchamber.ai).

## Disclaimer

To build the chambers you will need some common assembly tools and access to some more specialized equipment: a laser cutter of sufficient size and an electronics bench (for soldering and testing). We assume that you already posses the pertinent knowledge to use them.

<mark>If you lack the resources or time to build a chamber, you can also purchase one from us, or remotely access one through our **remote API**. Click [here](https://tally.so/r/wbNe0e) for more details.</mark>
