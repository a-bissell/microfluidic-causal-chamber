# Building the Chambers

Here you can find the resources to build the initial wind tunnel and light tunnel prototypes described in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf).

**Note**: We are still working on documenting the blueprints, electronics diagrams and component lists. Please check again soon or shoot us an [email](mailto:juangamella@gmail.com).

## Disclaimer

To build the chambers you will need some common assembly tools and access to some more specialized equipment: a laser cutter of sufficient size and an electronics bench (for soldering and testing). We assume that you already posses the pertinent knowledge to use them.

<mark>Instead of building one, you can submit experiments to a chamber through our **online service and API**. Click [here](https://tally.so/r/wbNe0e) for more details.</mark>
