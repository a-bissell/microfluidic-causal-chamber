# Building the Chambers

Here you can find the resources to build the wind tunnel and light tunnel described in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11341.pdf).

**Note**: We are still working on the blueprints, electronics diagrams and component lists for the chamber prototypes described in the paper. Please check again soon or shoot us (Juan) an email!

## Disclaimer

To build the chambers you will need some common assembly tools and access to some more specialized equipment: a laser cutter of sufficient size and an electronics bench (for soldering and testing). We assume that you already posses the pertinent knowledge to use them.

If you would like to build the chambers but lack the necessary skills, time, or equipment, we can build them for you for a fee. Please reach out to [Juan L. Gamella](mailto:juan.gamella@stat.math.ethz.ch) for such inquiries.
